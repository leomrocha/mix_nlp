   Coptic is a Unicode block used with the Greek and Coptic block to write
   the Coptic language. Prior to version 4.1 of the Unicode Standard,
   Greek and Coptic was used exclusively to write Coptic text, but Greek
   and Coptic letter forms are contrastive in many scholarly works,
   necessitating their disunification. Any specifically Coptic letters in
   the Greek and Coptic block are not reproduced in the Coptic Unicode
   block.
