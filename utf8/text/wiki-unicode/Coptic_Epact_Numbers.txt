   Coptic Epact Numbers is a Unicode block containing old Coptic number
   forms.

   These numbers were used in some regions instead of letters of the
   Coptic alphabet that were used for encoding numbers,^[3] as was common
   in much of the world at the time, like Roman numerals. It was used most
   extensively in the Bohairic dialect of the Coptic language that became
   the liturgical language of Egyptian Christians. It contains separate
   characters for each of the digits, 1-9 (0 was not indicated), each of
   the tens numbers from 10-90, and each of the hundreds numbers from
   100-900. Numbers were composed from left-to-right by successively
   adding the values that each character or digit represented. There is a
   thousand mark diacritic that multiplies the digit by one thousand (so 5
   with thousand mark = 5,000, 900 with thousand mark indicates 900,000)
   Two of the thousands marks together (visually similar to a tanween
   al-kasra in Arabic) represents a million in a similar fashion, and
   mirrors other Coptic conventions of indicating higher orders by
   repetition of marks.
