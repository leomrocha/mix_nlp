    "\n",
    "Currently NLP deals with *Out of Vocabulary* (OOV) in different ways, this leads to several non-necessarilly efficient ways of pre-processing NLP datasets to be able to deal with those input vocabularies and the need to rethink the issue for every new application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work we present different techniques of deteriministically encode character and token level input that deals with OOV and allows to encode all possible symbols in a computationally efficient manner to encode all (or part) of the UTF-8 domain in a fixed size vector. This input can be used as-is or can be compressed and efficiently pre-trained in a large vocabulary with an autoencoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques eliminate the need of complex and compute consuming pre-processing to find the existing tokens in the domain replacing it for a much simpler one that works for *any* dataset within the defined initial character subset defined (here we study utf-8 and some subsets of it). This work focuses on being able to encode a symbol, as once it is encoded the network that takes it as input can be fine-tunned without further modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are _not_ looking for winning the SoTA race to the bottom, we are looking for alternatives that expand knowledge and model usability under restricted resource usage and for more task variability in a single trained model.\n",

    "## Introduction and Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently for NLP tasks there is the need to first analyze the input domain, extract the tokens and train an embedding network while also the need to deal with *Out of Vocabulary* (OOV) words or symbols and Polysemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to separate (and we do in this work) the encoding part (to be able to represent the symbol) from the learning to use those symbols (the network to be able to do something useful with it) as this work focuses solely on being able to encode all feasible symbols in a defined text encoding domain. In this case the work is done for UTF-8 which is the most used text encoding in the web [94.6% according to w3techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/en-utf8).\n"

    "One of the most used techniques is [Byte Pair Encoding from Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units Sennrich et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909) which has the advantage of compressing the input vector size compared to character based models hence accelerates training compared to a full character level input on the current SoTA and at the same time having less number of tokens than word level, which shows a good compromise on both sides."

As a note, one pending task is to analyze ECCs in an end to end manner for a neural network. Some of these analysis (without proper formating) can be found in the notebooks folders at [text subfolder in the minibrain project](https://github.com/leomrocha/minibrain/tree/master/predictors/sequence/text) where most of the experimental code is located.\n",

    " - we create a basic code for the main base symbols from which all other symbols will be composed\n",
    " - now we create a new composed codebook of symbols, including the ones that created the base codebook (to have the same format). The composed symbols (like the á à ô ü ... etc ) are now composed by different operations on the basic symbols, this operations are convolution and sum of the vectors and some other analysis (upper/lower case, is num, is alpha, etc).  The final composed code is a concatenation of some of the created fields ( choosing all might be too big, this is a compromise choice)\n",

    " \n",

    "These languages specializations come in different files, so a network can load one of the models, and multiple models are needed for multiple languages. This leads to another issue, when more than one language is mixed (like would happen in a real multi-lingual scenario) on the same context, these networks can not necessarilly understand the mix. Even if it is not a real big issue, is something than in the reality of multi-lingual people happens often (like the author of this text) and frustrates, so would be a real nice to have.\n",

    " - allows for infinite vocabulary (unlike sentencepiece)\n",

In the case of wanting to correct the inputs we can do a similarity search before encoding and sending the vector to the neural network. Even if this would mean more pre-processing.\n",

This approach is not feasible if a batch contains many languages and can be slow due to memory transfer (although this is a compromise to take into account) This has the advantage of using many languanges, the disadvantage of this approach is that the foreign words (to the source language) would be encoded/decoded in a character-level base.\n",

A more comprehensive approach could be done, adding an external source where a head can attend to the resulting syntactic/semantic role of the token as well as many other references (tense, gender, number, declination, etc). This could be an interesting approach, as the representation of the different elements can be learnt, these heads can (and will) give external information, quantized by an internal representation in a memory with the different possibilities. Some extensions to this are already inplace in [Attending to Entities for Better Text Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04361)**\n",
