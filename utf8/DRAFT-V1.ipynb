    "Currently NLP deals with *Out of Vocabulary* (OOV) in different ways, this leads to several non-necessarilly efficient ways of pre-processing NLP datasets to be able to deal with \n",
    "In this work we present **Segment-Multihot-Encoding** (SME) a technique that deals with OOV and allows to encode all possible symbols in a computationally efficient manner to encode all (or part) of the UTF-8 domain in a fixed multi-hot encoding that can be further compressed by overfitting. This technique eliminates the need of complex and compute consuming pre-processing replacing it for a much more simple one that works for *any* dataset. This work focuses on being able to encode a symbol, as once it is encoded the network can be fine-tunned later to handle previously unseen ones.\n",

    "This work presents the SME technique for UTF8 and we call it **SME-UTF8**, the source code and encoding vectors are also given with usage examples.\n",

    "There is an extra advantage of this methodology is that with deterministic and defined process with small representation size can be implemented efficiently in hardware.\n",

In this case the work is done for UTF-8 which is the most used text encoding in the web [94.6% according to w3techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/en-utf8).\n"

As a note, one pending task is to analyze ECCs in an end to end manner for a neural network. Some of these analysis (without proper formating) can be found in the anex notebooks folders of this repository or at [text subfolder in the minibrain project](https://github.com/leomrocha/minibrain/tree/master/predictors/sequence/text) where most of the experimental code is located.\n",

Concerning the African scripts, there are two reasons not to include them here either, the first is the number of trainin samples, which is not much for the current work.

This leads to another issue, when more than one language is mixed (like would happen in a real multi-lingual scenario) on the same context, these networks can not necessarilly understand the mix.

This approach is not feasible if a batch contains many languages and can be slow due to memory transfer (although this is a compromise to take into account) This has the advantage of using many languanges, the disadvantage of this approach is that the foreign words (to the source language) would be encoded/decoded in a character-level base.\n",
    "- We could add the source and target language as extra information instead of making the network guess it. This would be a big extra help. This language information could also make the key source for a memory in the network that allows for different mappings.\n",

This could be a great approach, as the representation of the different elements can be learned, these heads can (and will) give external information, quantized by an internal representation in a memory with the different possibilities.
