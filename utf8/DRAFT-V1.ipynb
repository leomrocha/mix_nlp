    "\n",
    "Currently NLP deals with *Out of Vocabulary* (OOV) in different ways, this leads to several non-necessarilly efficient ways of pre-processing NLP datasets to be able to deal with \n",
    "In this work we present **Segment-Multihot-Encoding** (SME) a technique that deals with OOV and allows to encode all possible symbols in a computationally efficient manner to encode all (or part) of the UTF-8 domain in a fixed multi-hot encoding that can be further compressed by overfitting. This technique eliminates the need of complex and compute consuming pre-processing replacing it for a much more simple one that works for *any* dataset. This work focuses on being able to encode a symbol, as once it is encoded the network can be fine-tunned later to handle previously unseen ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work presents the SME technique for UTF8 and we call it **SME-UTF8**, the source code and encoding vectors are also given with usage examples.\n",

    "There is an extra advantage of this methodology is that with deterministic and defined process with small representation size can be implemented efficiently in hardware.\n",

In this case the work is done for UTF-8 which is the most used text encoding in the web [94.6% according to w3techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/en-utf8).\n"

As a note, one pending task is to analyze ECCs in an end to end manner for a neural network. Some of these analysis (without proper formating) can be found in the anex notebooks folders of this repository or at [text subfolder in the minibrain project](https://github.com/leomrocha/minibrain/tree/master/predictors/sequence/text) where most of the experimental code is located."

Concerning the African scripts, there are two reasons not to include them here either, the first is the number of trainin samples, which is not much for the current work.

It is known in the domain that one of the performance issues is the existence of big softmax layers, this is so that [multiple](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkwZSG-CZ) [studies](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7312-sigsoftmax-reanalysis-of-the-softmax-bottleneck.pdf) [try](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7130-svd-softmax-fast-softmax-approximation-on-large-vocabulary-neural-networks.pdf) [to](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04309.pdf) [limit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02867.pdf) [the](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10668.pdf) [performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05737.pdf) issue generated by them.

Although rest to be measured as future work depending on the actual size of the softmax (too small vectors might not take the real advantage of GPGPUs) , maybe for really small vectors might be just good enough to do some clipping and binarization, or just put the biggest element to 1 and the rest to 0, which would have the issue of not beign differentiable. \n",
