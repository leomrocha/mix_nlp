    "Currently NLP deals with *Out of Vocabulary* (OOV) in different ways, this leads to several non-necessarilly efficient ways of pre-processing NLP datasets to be able to deal with \n",
    "In this work we present **Segment-Multihot-Encoding** (SME) a technique that deals with OOV and allows to encode all possible symbols in a computationally efficient manner to encode all (or part) of the UTF-8 domain in a fixed multi-hot encoding that can be further compressed by overfitting. This technique eliminates the need of complex and compute consuming pre-processing replacing it for a much more simple one that works for *any* dataset. This work focuses on being able to encode a symbol, as once it is encoded the network can be fine-tunned later to handle previously unseen ones.\n",

In this case the work is done for UTF-8 which is the most used text encoding in the web [94.6% according to w3techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/en-utf8).\n"

As a note, one pending task is to analyze ECCs in an end to end manner for a neural network. Some of these analysis (without proper formating) can be found in the anex notebooks folders of this repository or at [text subfolder in the minibrain project](https://github.com/leomrocha/minibrain/tree/master/predictors/sequence/text) where most of the experimental code is located."
