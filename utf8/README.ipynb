    "Currently NLP deals with *Out of Vocabulary* (OOV) in different ways, this leads to several non-necessarilly efficient ways of pre-processing NLP datasets to be able to deal with \n",
    "In this work we present **Segment-Multihot-Encoding** (SME) a technique that deals with OOV and allows to encode all possible symbols in a computationally efficient manner to encode all (or part) of the UTF-8 domain in a fixed multi-hot encoding that can be further compressed by overfitting. This technique eliminates the need of complex and compute consuming pre-processing replacing it for a much more simple one that works for *any* dataset. This work focuses on being able to encode a symbol, as once it is encoded the network can be fine-tunned later to handle previously unseen ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to separate (and we do in this work) the encoding part (to be able to represent the symbol) from the learning to use those symbols (the network to be able to do something useful with it) as this work focuses solely on being able to encode all feasible symbols in a defined text encoding domain. In this case the work is done for UTF-8 which is the most used text encoding in the web [94.6% according to w3techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/en-utf8).\n"

As a note, one pending task is to analyze ECCs in an end to end manner for a neural network."
