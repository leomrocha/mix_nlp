    "## Goals\n",
    "For the current work the training is focused in learning language representations for:\n",
    "* multi-lingual\n",
    "* multi-task\n",
    "* Text-to-Text (similar to T5 from DeepMind) \n",
    "\n",
    "With the goal of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Few-Shot|Zero-Shot] learning of new tasks\n",
    "* Zero-Shot translation for language pairs\n",
    "* Being able to add new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting\n",
    "\n",
    "The particularity of the trained model is that they are intended to be able to recognize and solve the given tasks solely from the description in the input. The models should be able to perform well enough without any retraining or fine-tunning. Any re-training or fine-tunning should also be able to be done without hindering (much?) the previously trained tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also there is the important point to make that all this work focuses on having an input as RAW as possible (meaning no text normalization, separation, .... etc) and having NO Out of Vocabulary (OOV) input. So all the languages should be feasible as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly the model should have multiple outputs being those the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Origin Language (language detection) - Language Name (would be less confusing and more informative than code)\n",
    "~~2. Destination Language (the original one if none given) - Language Name~~\n",
    "~~3. Task Language (The language in which the task was described) - Language CODE (2 or 3 character code)~~\n",
    "4. The task at hand\n",
    "5. **The TARGET output** of the task for the current input\n",
    "\n",
    "~~5. PoS UPOS tagging ckech if needed or useful?~~\n"

    "## Training\n",
    "\n",
    "The current work follows the example of [ERNIE 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12412) in that uses supervised training to improve the performance. In that paper they show that supervised tasks allow better training than just Denoising LM target with unsupervised learning. \n",
    "In this work we leverage many other tasks and meta-learning to take advantage of existing mono and multi-lingual training datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training will be done in the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A general pre-training with many datapoints on all the tasks\n",
    "    - Evaluation on different validation sets\n",
    "2. A few-shot meta-learninig training based on the pre-trained weights\n",
    "    - Evaluation on different validation sets\n",
    "3. Add architectural changes to the network (parallel columns and memory) and train for tasks with the meta-learned \n",
    "    - Evaluation on different validation sets and tasks\n",
    "4. Overfit new input or input that fails -> create an entry in the memory for it.\n",
    "    - Evaluate\n",
    "5. ... ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition between all this is:\n",
    " - Having a strong statistical baseline with many tasks\n",
    " - Meta-learning to be able to quickly learn new tasks\n",
    " - Use the few-shot learn ability to be able to add new knowledge in the memory as in [Large Memory Layers with Product Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.052420)"
